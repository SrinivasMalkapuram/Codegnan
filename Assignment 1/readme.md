This repository Folder Assignment 1 contains a collection of Java programs that demonstrate the use of loops—for, while, and do-while—to solve various basic and intermediate programming problems. These programs are part of my Java practice and assignment work.

📂 Topics Covered
Printing patterns using loops

Working with numbers (prime, palindrome, factorial, etc.)

Nested loops for complex outputs

Loop-based string manipulation

Using loops with arrays

🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
Language: Java

IDE: Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or Online Compiler

📌 Sample Programs Included
Print numbers from 1 to N using loops

Reverse a number using a while loop

Generate multiplication table

Check for prime number using loops

Print Fibonacci series using for loop

Nested loops for pattern printing (e.g., pyramid, triangle)

Count digits/letters using loop
